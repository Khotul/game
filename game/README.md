This is the Tower Storm game code. It is the core logic, engine, images and so on. It is everything the client loads when they start
up a new game. 

The reason it's a seperate project is so that the Tower Storm game server and the Bot Manager can both use this code without having duplication. 
That way bots can be playing exactly the same game as players.

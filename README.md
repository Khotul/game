# About Fork

Main focus of this fork is to fix issues and bugs occuring in the original version of the game,
while trying to avoid any core changes as much as possible.

As such, this fork doesn't provide much additional functionality that isn't already there.

## Why?

I love tower defense genre, and as a creative person, I also love modding existing games. However, there aren't many multiplayer TD games that support modding (almost any). The templates or open source projects are also scarced, most of them being completely barebones.

This one is really ahead of the rest, written in a way where reworking core to fit your idea is pretty simple to do.

And for creative but unskilled people adding new stuff is simple and easy. Even someone who never touched programming can do so. Could. If setting up the source wasn't so complicated.

That's why I decided to make a fork focused mostly on making the source easier to set up, as well as patching any game-breaking bugs.

## Why only bugs?

I have my own idea of what to make with this source, however it derives greatly from the original game. That fork will stay as a private for the time being.

As such, I decided to only carry the bug fixes and potentially some improvements (ex. dynamic bot configuration for host, instead of it being randomized based on config) from that version.
